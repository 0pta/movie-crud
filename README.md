# MOVIE CRUD

### Make your own movie rating site.

- Fork and Clone this repository
- Deploy your site
- You do not have to match the mockups exactly, but the app should be attractive.
- This is a CRUD assessment. Your first priority is to get all of the routes working. Your second prioirty is CSS. It's open book: you can look at previous CRUD apps you've built for guidance, but you should NOT be copying and pasting any code.

## HOME PAGE

- Your homepage can be whatever you want.  Make sure it has a link to your index page.

## INDEX PAGE

- Your index page should list all your movies.  The titles of the movies should link to that movies show page. There should be a button that links to each movie's edit page and a button to delete each movie.
